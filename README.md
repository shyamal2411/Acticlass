## Instructions for Build/deployment

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Deployment

To deploy the Acticlass server locally, Open a terminal in the [_Acticlass-API_](Acticlass-API/) directory of the Acticlass app.

- Run the following command:

  ```bash
  # installing reqired packages
  npm install

  # using npm
  npm start

  # OR using Yarn
  yarn start
  ```

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the Acticlass server.

### Build

#### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_.

To start Metro, run the following command from the [_Acticlass-App_](Acticlass-App/).

```bash
# installing reqired packages
npm install

# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

#### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the [_Acticlass-App_](Acticlass-App/). Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

##### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

##### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully deployed Acticlass App. :partying_face:
